# DynamicProgrammingPractice
Dynamic Programming practice as part of my Data Structures and Algorithms preparation!

/src/maxPath.java : finding the max weighted path from (0,0) to (grid.height,grid.weight) in a grid using DP. Assumes the grid is a square. Recursive and iterative DP memoization solutions were both implemented in this file. My first successful DP program :)
